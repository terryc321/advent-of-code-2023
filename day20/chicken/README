flipflop.scm
has a single state either on or off
whereas conjunction has multiple inputs 

conjunction.scm
does AND conjunction if all inputs are HIGH then sends a LOW pulse
conjunction module has to know all of the inputs that are

(make-flipflop a (b))
(make-flipflop b (c))
(make-flipflop c (inv))
(make-conjunction inv (c) (a))

broadcaster -> a ,b ,c

but time say c is defined inv is not defined

---------------------------------
(begin
 (define a #f)
 (define b (list a))
 (set! a (list '1 2 3))
 b)

b will not reflect fact that a has been reassigned
--------------------------------
(define v (make-vector 10))
;; assign a to be slot 0 in v
(vector-set! v 0 (list 1 2 3))
v

if pass in a way to reference into vector v then it will 

--------------------------------
